# NightMonkeys

A collection of ImageIO plugins, adding support for newer image formats. NightMonkeys uses the Foreign Linker API
available since JDK 22 to access native libraries.

## How it works

NightMonkeys plugins are released as multi-release JARs:

- with Java < 22, a no-op version of the plugin will unregister itself on load, basically doing nothing
- with Java 22+, the plugin will be available

This lets you add the dependencies in your project whatever the JDK used, and still enable the plugin at runtime if the necessary JDK is used. 

## Supported formats

When possible, the plugins will use the extensive test suite
from [TwelveMonkeys](https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys), which covers much more test cases than simple
decoding/encoding.

## Requirements

In order for the plugins to run properly, you will need to:

- Run Java 22 with the following options:

```
--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED
```

- Make sure the path to the directory containing the native libraries is contained in the Java system
  property `java.library.path` (check
  also [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20038789/default-java-library-path)).
  - For Linux, normally it works fine when installed from a package manager. You can add the libraries' path to
    the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
  - For Mac, if using HomeBrew, you will need to set `JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH` to `/usr/local/lib/` or `/opt/homebrew/lib/`.
